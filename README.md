# CurrencyExchangeAgent
HackAI IITB Techfest

This is an AI agent that utilizes Fetch.aiâ€™s uAgents library to:
 1. Allows users to select their base currency and one or more foreign currencies they wish to monitor.
 2. Connects to a currency exchange API to fetch real-time exchange rates.
 3. Lets users set thresholds for alerts (e.g., notify me if 1 USD becomes more than 82.60 INR or less
than 82.55 EUR).
 4. Sends an alert/notification to the user when the exchange rate crosses the thresholds they've set.
